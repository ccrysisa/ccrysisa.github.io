# Rust Coding: Build a Ranked-choice voting site

## 影片注解

### Ranked-choice voting

- [Ranked-choice voting (RCV)](https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV))
> In instant-runoff voting, if a candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, he or she is declared the winner. If no candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated. Ballots that ranked a failed candidate as their first, or highest choice, depending on the round, are then reevaluated and counted as first-preference ballots for the next highest ranked candidate in that round. A new tally is conducted to determine whether any candidate has won a majority ballots. The process is repeated until a candidate wins an outright majority.

  <title>Command Line Applications in Rust</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a statically compiled, fast language with great tooling and a rapidly growing ecosystem. That makes it a great fit for writing command line applications: They should be small, portable, and quick to run. Command line applications are also a great way to get started with learning Rust; or to introduce Rust to your team!</p>

  <title>Crust of Rust: Subtying and Variance</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In this episode of Crust of Rust, we go over subtyping and variance — a niche part of Rust that most people don&rsquo;t have to think about, but which is deeply ingrained in some of Rust&rsquo;s borrow ergonomics, and occasionally manifests in confusing ways. In particular, we explore how trying to implement the relatively straightforward <code>strtok</code> function from C/C++ in Rust quickly lands us in a place where the function is more or less impossible to call due to variance!</p>

  <title>Crust of Rust: Sorting Algorithms</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In this Crust of Rust episode, we implement some common sorting algorithms in Rust. This episode doesn't aim to explain any single concept, but rather showcase what writing &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Rust code is like, and explaining various &ldquo;odd bits&rdquo; we come across along the way. The thinking here is that sorting algorithms are both familiar and easy to compare across languages, so this might serve as a good bridge into Rust if you are familiar with other languages.</p>

  <title>Crust of Rust: Channels</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In this (fifth) Crust of Rust video, we cover multi-produce/single-consumer (mpsc) channels, by re-implementing some of the std::sync::mpsc types from the standard library. As part of that, we cover what channels are used for, how they work at a high level, different common channel variants, and common channel implementations. In the process, we go over some common Rust concurrency primitives like Mutex and Condvar.</p>

  <title>Crust of Rust: Smart Pointers and Interior Mutability</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In this fourth Crust of Rust video, we cover smart pointers and interior mutability, by re-implementing the Cell, RefCell, and Rc types from the standard library. As part of that, we cover when those types are useful, how they work, and what the equivalent thread-safe versions of these types are. In the process, we go over some of the finer details of Rust's ownership model, and the UnsafeCell type. We also dive briefly into the Drop Check rabbit hole (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/dropck.html"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/dropck.html</a>) before coming back up for air.</p>

  <title>Impl Rust: TCP/IP</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In this stream, we started implementing the ubiquitous TCP protocol that underlies much of the traffic on the internet! In particular, we followed RFC 793 — <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793</a> — which describes the original protocol, with the goal of being able to set up and tear down a connection with a &ldquo;real&rdquo; TCP stack at the other end (netcat in particular). We&rsquo;re writing it using a user-space networking interface (see <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt</a> and the Rust bindings at <a href="https://docs.rs/tun-tap/%29"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://docs.rs/tun-tap/)</a>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In this third Crust of Rust video, we cover iterators and trait bounds, by re-implementing the &ldquo;flatten&rdquo; Iterator method from the standard library. As part of that, we cover some of the weirder trait bounds that are required, including what&rsquo;s needed to extend the implementation to support backwards iteration.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In this second Crust of Rust video, we cover declarative macros, macro_rules!, by re-implementing the vec! macro from the standard library. As part of that, we cover not only how to write these, but some of the gotchas and tricks you&rsquo;ll run into, and some common use-cases.</p>

  <title>Crust of Rust: Lifetime Annotations</title>

  <guid>https://ccrysisa.github.io/posts/lifetime-annotations/</guid>
  <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to investigate a case where you need multiple explicit lifetime annotations. We explore why they are needed, and why we need more than one in this particular case. We also talk about some of the differences between the string types and introduce generics over a self-defined trait in the process.</p>

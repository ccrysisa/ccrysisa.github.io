  description: Hi there! I'm a Principal Engineer at Helsing, author of Rust for Rustaceans, an avid Rust educator, and a general open-source ethusiast. I have a PhD from the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group at MIT, where I was supervised by Robert Morris in my work on Noria, which today continues in the form of a start-up I co-founded called ReadySet.

  description: The part of the solution to the software problem that I am most interested in is using software tools to make it easier to develop correct and efficient software. Basically, we can create programs to show us possibilities inherent in our software -- such as crashes -- that we did not know about, or better yet create programs to verify that such possibilities do not exist. Similarly, good abstractions such as high-level programming languages make it easier to express our intent, and then we can offload to software tools the problem of making programs run quickly.

  description: I'm an author and speaker, and a programming language nerd whose focus is on enabling our program code to be both clean and fast. I've been writing about programming since 1993, usually about C++ or about concurrency and parallelism. I'm the designer or co-designer of a number of standardized ISO C++ language and library features. I've served as the chair of the ISO C++ standards committee since 2002, and as the chair of the Standard C++ Foundation since 2012. I'm a technical fellow at Citadel Securities. This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.
